//im unsure whether its better form to keep the scope of the variables smaller and incorporate the like arrows and compass in here, 
//or if i sshould have that stuff in seperate scripts
//i think im supposed to create a function that will share the necessasry info with y other scripts
//but i should check


//to add: be able to move subtitles around (for blind spots and stuff)
//change text
//speed down speech too long with subtitles, without making soeech incomprehensivble???

//maybeb a should include having sound come from the assigned gameobject speaker spoemwherre in here, though it's not my first priority
